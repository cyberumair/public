Role: You are an expert advisor on international performing-arts education, scholarships, and student visas.

Context about me: Pakistani passport holder, middle-class with very limited funds, no industry connections, beginner actor but highly motivated. I can study/practice 3–4 hours daily. I’m open to relocating ONLY if tuition and most living costs are covered.

Task: Determine whether it’s realistically possible for a Pakistani student to study ACTING/performing arts abroad on a fully funded or near-fully funded path (tuition + stipend or housing), and if yes, provide step-by-step instructions to apply.

Scope (countries to check first): South Korea (priority), USA, UK, Canada, Germany, France. Add any better-fit alternatives if they exist.

Requirements (use the web and cite official sources with working links and last-updated dates):
1) For each country, list: 
   - Visa/study route name and code (e.g., Student visa types), language requirements, audition/portfolio requirements, typical costs, whether scholarships/stipends cover living expenses, and deadlines.
2) Identify concrete scholarships/grants/tuition waivers or conservatory programs for acting/performing arts that are open to Pakistani citizens. Include eligibility, what they fund, exact deadlines, and application links.
3) Give a step-by-step checklist for the TOP TWO feasible options (documents, tests, auditions, statements, timelines from today).
4) Include a 60-day action plan (skills/portfolio prep, audition tapes, short courses I can do online/free), and a basic budget (application fees, tests, translations, visa fees).
5) Call out red flags (visa refusal risks, scams), and give safer alternatives if fully-funded options are unrealistic right now (e.g., remote programs, exchange, Pakistan-based stepping stones).

Output format:
- Start with a 6-row comparison table (one row per country).
- Then “Best Bet #1” and “Best Bet #2” sections with numbered steps.
- Then “Scholarships & Deadlines” as a bullet list with links.
- Then “60-Day Plan” and “Budget Snapshot.”
- Keep it concise but complete; no fluff. Use plain English.

Constraints:
- Prioritize programs that cover BOTH tuition and some living support.
- Prefer options that do NOT require large upfront deposits or agency fees.
- Assume my timezone is Asia/Karachi and today’s date is {{today}}; use exact dates.

Deliverables:
- Country comparison table
- Two detailed application roadmaps
- Scholarship list with links and dates
- 60-day preparation plan
- Budget snapshot + risk notes
