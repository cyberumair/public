## 📌 Title: Urgent Help Needed – Report Fake Page

---

Hello!  
Someone has made a fake Facebook page pretending to be my business.  
I need your help to report it so Facebook removes it quickly.  

If we all report it for 3 days in a row, Facebook will take it down.

Here’s what to do (takes less than 2 minutes):

---

### 📍 Step 1 – Open the Fake Page
🔗 https://facebook.com/dialo3studio

---

### 📍 Step 2 – Report Using These Steps

1. Click on the “…” under the page’s cover photo.
2. Select **“Find support or report Page”**.

**First group of people → Choose “Pretending to be a business”**  
_Paste this text:_
> This page is impersonating our business and using our brand name without permission.  
> We are the real owners of this business but lost access to the managing account.  
> Please remove this page to prevent confusion and protect our brand identity.

**Second group of people → Choose “Misleading or fraudulent”**  
_Paste this text:_
> This page misleads people by pretending to be an official business.  
> It is not authorized by the real owner and may be used for scams.  
> Please remove or disable it to protect the public from fraud.

3. Click **Submit**.

### 📍 Step 3 – Repeat for 3 Days

- **Day 1:** Morning report  
- **Day 2:** Afternoon report  
- **Day 3:** Evening report  

💡 If Facebook replies _“it doesn’t go against our standards”_, click **“I still see this content”** — it forces them to re-check.

### 📍 Extra Boost

If you have 1 extra minute, also submit this official complaint form:  
👉 https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/208282075858952

Choose **“I found content which I believe infringes my rights”**.  
Fill details & paste the **Pretending to be a business** text.

---

⚠️ The more people report, the faster it’s gone — aim for **20+ people over 3 days**.  

Thank you so much for your help! 🙏
